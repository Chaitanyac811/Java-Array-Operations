# Java Array Sorting Project

## 📌 Description
This is a simple Java console-based application that:
- Prompts the user to input 5 different numbers
- Stores them in an array
- Sorts the array using a custom sorting algorithm (without built-in functions)
- Finds and displays the second highest and second lowest numbers

This project also demonstrates basic usage of Git and GitHub for version control using multiple branches and pull requests.
